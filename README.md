## What do you need to install:
Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)


## Steps for correct code execution:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and create server.js file.

2. Paste the code from server.js (which I submitted) into your server.js file (from my server.js to your server.js).

3. Create 'mychat' directory and create there chat.css, chat.html, chat.js files.

4. Paste the codes from my submitted codes to your files (from my chat.css to your chat.css, from your chat.html to your chat.html, from my chat.js to your chat.js).

5. Write in terminal:

### npm install express 
### node server.js

6. If everything is okay in terminal will appear 'Server is running on port 3000'.
7. You can open MyChat on different browsers or pages and write different messages.
8. To open the chat, go to http://localhost:3000/static/chat.html
